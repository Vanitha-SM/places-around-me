                    Chennai International Airport (IATA: MAA, ICAO: VOMM) is an international airport serving the city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu and its metropolitan area. It is located in Meenambakkam, around 20 km (12 mi) southwest of the city centre. Chennai International Airport is the 4th busiest airport in India[4] and third busiest airport for international traffic in India.[5] It was also 49th busiest airport in Asia in 2018 making it one of the four major airports in India under the top 50 list of 2018.[6] In financial year 2021, the airport handled 9.53 million passengers.[7]

The airport is served by the airport metro station of the Chennai Metro and the Tirusulam railway station of the Chennai Suburban Railway system. To cope with the passenger traffic, two new terminals, including one satellite terminal, are under construction to handle 40 million passengers per year.[8] Once completed, it will be India's first airport to have a satellite terminal. The new satellite terminal will be connected through a four way underground walkalator for passenger movement across different terminals.[9] Still, the Tirusulam airport complex is expected to reach saturation by 2035, with a peak capacity of 40 million passengers, and a proposal for a new greenfield airport in Parandur has been approved. Once the new airport is commissioned, both the airports will be functional.
