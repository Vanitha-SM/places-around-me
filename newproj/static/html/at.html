                    his Hindu temple is located in Nanganallur, Chennai and is dedicated to Lord Shiva.
According to the historical legend, an old man once tried to clean the tank or pond in his land. While cleaning, he found idols of the temple in the tank submerged and buried. These idols were immediately cleaned and moved to a tent with a thatched roof. At the beginning, worshipping of these idols began by the lighting of lamps. The Hindu temple was built later on.
As the deityâ€™s idol was under water for a long period, he is known as Jalakandeswarar( Jal standing for water). Later on the name was changed to Arthanareeswara. Arthanareeswara is the form of the supreme being representing both male and female forms at the same time. The devotee worshipping the Linga found at this Indian temple, accept the concept of worshipping Shiva and Devi together.
